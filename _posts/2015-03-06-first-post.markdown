#**What I did today**:

  1. Learned how to setup this blog =)

  3. Reviewed Enumerable methods 

  4. Worked on a Roman Numeral Kata

  5. Watched Bret Victorâ€™s talk: [Inventing on Principle][Inventing on Principle]


**Some helpful tips I learned to start the Jekyll server:** 

`$Jeykll serve`

**To find arguments running on local host port 4000:**

`$lsof -wni tcp:4000`

**To kill a process on a specified port:**

`$kill -9 PID`
